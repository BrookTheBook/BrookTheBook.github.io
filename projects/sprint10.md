## Inspiration

This was supposed to be the Capstone for this Course, so I created a game that I knew everyone loved!

## What it does

It follows the same controls as the Snake Game, but once you run into the wall, you have to press the button at the bottom to reset the game.

## How we built it

I followed a tutorial over how to do it. It used mainly JavaScript.

## Challenge we ran into

The only challenge I ran into was resetting the game. I solved that by adding a reset button at the bottom.
